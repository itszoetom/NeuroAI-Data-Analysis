This will cover most of the code used for the creation of a prelim figure for
encoding. I plan to complete the following:
1.) For each paradigm, go through and calculate the FR under each trial condition, averaged acorss trials of that condition
2.) Calculate a p-value for if firing rate changes significantly from baseline under each condition
3.) Calculate for each paradigm
4.) Calculate which fraction of cells are mixed and pure selectivity for each brain region
